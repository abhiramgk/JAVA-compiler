# JAVA-compiler
JAVA (if-else and for constructs) compiler using C
This compiler completely handles IF-ELSE and FOR constructs but it does so only for INT,FLOAT and DOUBLE data type (not including arrays). I plan to improve this code sometime in the future, handling other data types and also trying other constructs.
